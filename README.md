## A computational model of reading across development: Effects of literacy onset on language processing 
（https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749596X19300488#:~:text=A%20developmental%20model%20of%20reading,of%20mappings%20in%20the%20model.）
Highlights
•A developmental model of reading was implemented based on connectionist principles.
•The influence of early experience on lexical processing was examined.
•AoA effects arise from both representation and plasticity of mappings in the model.
•Vestigial traces of acquisition were reflected in different uses of reading pathways.
